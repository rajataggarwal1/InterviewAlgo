 * Imagine we have an image. We'll represent this image as a simple 2D array where every pixel is a 1 or a 0.

The image you get is known to have potentially many distinct rectangles of 0s on a background of 1s. Write a function that takes in the image and returns the coordinates of all the 0 rectangles -- top-left and bottom-right; or top-left, width and height.

image1 = [
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
  [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
  [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
  [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
  [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1],
  [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1],
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
]

Sample output:
findRectangles(image1) =>
  // (using top-left and bottom-right):
  [
    [[0,0],[0,0]],
    [[2,0],[2,0]],
    [[2,3],[3,5]],
    [[3,1],[5,1]],
    [[5,3],[6,4]],
    [[7,6],[7,6]],
  ]
